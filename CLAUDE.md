## Project

**agent86 — Interactive Milestone (v0.6)**

agent86 is a Python agentic harness on the command line: it connects to remote or local
models (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, Ollama, llama.cpp) and lets them use tools,
skills, and MCP servers. This milestone makes the interactive experience **Claude-Code-like** —
a full-screen TUI with menus, in-CLI configuration of model connections and MCP servers, and a
status line that stays live while a turn is processing.

**Core Value:** The user can run, configure, and steer the agent entirely from within an interactive terminal
app — switching models, wiring up MCP servers, and watching live progress — without hand-editing
TOML or restarting.

### Constraints

- **Performance**: Core deps are deliberately light so `agent86` starts fast. New deps
  (Textual, keyring, tomlkit) MUST be lazy-imported — `run` (one-shot) and `--plain` must not
  import them, and cold-start for scripting must not regress.
- **Compatibility**: The plain loop and `run --json` are the scripting/CI contract and must keep
  working unchanged. keyring absence (headless/CI) must silently fall through to env vars.
- **Tech stack**: Python ≥3.11, Textual (TUI), keyring (secrets), tomlkit (config write-back),
  prompt_toolkit (retained for plain loop), Rich, Typer, Pydantic v2.
- **Platform**: Primary dev/test on Windows 11 (console quirks already handled via UTF-8
  reconfigure in `cli.py`); must also work on macOS/Linux.

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd:quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd:debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd:execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
